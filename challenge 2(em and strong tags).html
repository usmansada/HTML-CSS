        <strong>Nobody’s </strong> born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <em>learn</em>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble</em>, <em>slip</em>, <em>crawl</em>, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating</em>. <em>Confusing</em>. <em>Trying</em>. <em>Struggling</em>.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <strong>learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn <strong>anything</strong>.
