    <p1>
         The pain, the sorrow and the challenge <br><br>
        what to say when she cuddle me in her womb for 9 months <br><br>
        what to say after the sacrifices she made <br><br>
        the tears, the joy and the happiness.  <br><br>
        <br><br>
    </p1>
    <p2>
        i wish i could take away the tears <br><br>
        a promise i take to always make you happy <br><br>
        vow before you, here am your slave <br><br>
        you are my world Mama; my pride.
